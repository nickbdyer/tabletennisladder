Table Tennis Ladder
===================

Christmas project at Makers Academy, create a table tennis ladder, for use
for the final few weeks. 

- The problem

  This project was inspired by the work carried out by 3 of our senior cohort, 
  their work is shown [here](https://github.com/danjocutler/tournament_prog).

  The only difficult presented by their method was that the tournament's
  progress, was limited to the willingness of other people to play their
  games. This resulted in the tournament not being completed. 

- The idea

  We have opted for a ladder configuration, something a few of us are familiar
  with from playing squash. This format prevents the issue relating to
  progression, but does mean that people don't necessarily have the same number
  of games played at the end of the season. However, the latter has been deemed
  the lesser evil in this case.
